*** Instructions ***

To begin, you decide on a score goal (e.g The first to get 50 points (or higher))

For each round of the games you roll a dice to decide how many points you get
The winner of the round is the person who is the closest to 13 (must not be higher)

If you win the round then your score will increase by the number you got,
If you were to roll a double on your first oll (e.g. 2 6s) 
then you gain DOUBLE the amount of points (12 x 2 = 24)

If you lose the round you gain 0 points

If there is a tie then both players get the same number of points added 
For example - You roll 11 and the Computer rolls 11, this means you both gain 11 points

Your goal is to get the target score (or higher) first before the Computer does
